# ValiDAO nodes
Our deployment process may seem a bit overcomplicated,
but from our experience, these steps are worth taking.

We run on a significant amount of servers, we validate
a number of project, and having a uniform approach for
each allows us to:

  * spent minimal effort to migrate the server,
  * make it possible for any team member to migrate or update any software,
  * be able to act 24/7.

We are happy to share with you our playbooks because we think
that transparency matters.


Cheers!
